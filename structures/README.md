# Structures

This folder is where the program converts all your NBT files into mcstructure files.

There are lots of vanilla NBT structures extracted from Minecraft in this directory, they're mainly for testing the program against GitHub actions.

If you're using this program for personal use, consider removing all files in this directory.
